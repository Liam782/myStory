Once upon a time, there was a boy named Joe, he was walking back from school with his friend. After a while, his friend turned down
a different path towards his home. Joe kept on walking towards his home as he passed the new dam that the people had built a year ago,
there he saw a crack, with water trickling down the side of the dam. Joe had heard his father talk aabout how dangerous it could be if 
there was a hole in the wall of the dam. Joe thought for a moment, then stuck his hand in the hole, it fit perfectly.
